# How-Troll-are-you-Measuring-and-Detecting-Troll-Behavior-in-Online-Social-Networks

Code for the implementation of the approach presented in "How Troll are you Measuring and Detecting Troll Behavior in Online Social Networks?"

1. RNN-LSTM Classification.ipynb: Notebook contains 

          - Trajectory Formation
          - LSTM Model training
          - LSTM Model evaluation
          - Troll Score Computation
          - CDF Plot for the computed scores
          
2. Troll Score Classification.ipynb: Notebook contains

          - Load the computed scores
          - Compute the threshold that leads to the best auc, accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, TNR
          - Display the results
